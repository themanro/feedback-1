# nrrrdcore/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from 
[@mdo's feedback repo](https://github.com/mdo/feedback) which was forked from [@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and seems like a pretty fantastic 
idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off 
[asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.
